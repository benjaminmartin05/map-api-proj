===============================

Students should use this set of [project details](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd001/parts/00113454014/modules/271165859175462/lessons/2711658591239847/concepts/26906985370923#) to complete the map project.

Here is a note on  [plagarism guidelines](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd001/parts/00113454014/modules/271165859175462/lessons/2711658591239847/concepts/425224f8-c05e-4a68-8daf-7db8bcfc0766#).

## Helpful map project information:
* I used the [developers tools](https://developers.google.com/maps/) from google maps to primarily build my project making adjustments to their examples.
* [Knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com/) and the listed examples were also used to create my links.
* Previous lessons from [Udacity](http://udacity.com/) were also used along with examples quite a bit in creating this project.
